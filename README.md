My greatest challenge with this project was the absence of a base codebase to start with and add the required component given the time limit of 48 hours which was allotted for the completion of the project. 

My approach to this challenge however was to first understand the problem and then break it down into smaller sub-problems. I started by seeking out a skeleton of a previous react based page previously built with a similar architecture and editing and capitalizing on that to achieve the desire result within the time limit of 48 hours from when I first saw the challenge. 

The result from this project can obviously be optimized on but to send the message accross this should be enough to verify my ability as a front end developer, If I make it through the challenge whatever optimizations are needed can be implemented.

Having a Ui/Ux designer could have helped but with what I had I did what I could on such short notice I hope this should do for now.
